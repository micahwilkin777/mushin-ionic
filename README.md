## Mushin Ionic App

Public url: [mushin.surge.sh](mushin.surge.sh)

### Installation

This is not the default Ionic directory structure!

The project uses Grunt for compiling scss files and live reload.

You should have npm and grunt installed. Then simply run `grunt` in the project's directory.

Feel free to change the directory structure.

### To do

Must upgrade to [Ionic 2](http://ionicframework.com/docs/v2/getting-started/installation/) because Ionic 1 (current) doesn't have support for Windows Phone.
